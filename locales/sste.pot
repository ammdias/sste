"----\n"
"\n"
"SSTE is a text editor (simple text) that stores the files encrypted\n"
"by GnuPG, either with a symmetric encryption key or [several] public keys.\n"
"\n"
"Encryption with public keys allows the sharing of an encrypted text document\n"
"by a group of people without the need to share a common password, encrypting the\n"
"document with the public keys of all people who needs access it. Encryption with\n"
"public keys is also convenient for a single user, as it doesn't require a\n"
"password input at saving the documents, only for opening.\n"
"\n"
"Encryption with symmetric keys, the default, must be used when at least one of\n"
"the users doesn't have a GnuPG private/public key pair.\n"
"\n"
"Depends on Python 3.4+, with Tkinter, and GnuPG 2.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Installation and first run\n"
"==========================\n"
"\n"
"To install, simply uncompress the zip file, navigate to the uncompressed\n"
"directory and run 'sste.py' with Python 3.\n"
"\n"
"Alternately, in Linux or other Unix-like operating system, you may use the\n"
"included installation script to install the program:\n"
"\n"
"    $ python3 INSTALL.py\n"
"\n"
"The program will try to find the GnuPG executable in the PATH.  If it can not\n"
"find it, it will prompt the user to manually provide the path in the Settings\n"
"Dialog (see below).  If GnuPG is not installed in your system, please download\n"
"it from the system's software store or, at your option, from the GnuPG site:\n"
"\n"
"* https://gnupg.org/download/index.html\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Usage\n"
"=====\n"
"\n"
"The program works as any common graphical simple-text editor.  You may insert,\n"
"delete, select, copy and paste text as usual.  When saving, you will be prompted\n"
"to insert and confirm a password to encrypt the file.  Similarly, when opening\n"
"a file the program will ask for a password to decrypt the file.  If public keys\n"
"are used to encrypt the file, the password to the keys will only be asked when\n"
"opening the file.\n"
"\n"
"Below is a description of the menu items and its actions:\n"
"\n"
"File menu\n"
"---------\n"
"\n"
"* New: start editing a new file.  If the file you were currently editing was\n"
"       modified since the last save you will be prompted to save it.\n"
"\n"
"* Open: open a saved file.  When prompted insert the password used to encrypt\n"
"        the file or to open the private key to decrypt it.\n"
"\n"
"* Save: save the current file. If you are using symmetric encryption, which is\n"
"        the default, enter the secret password to encrypt the file when\n"
"        prompted.\n"
"\n"
"* Save as: save the current file with a different name.\n"
"\n"
"* Save to: save the current file encrypted for a selected list of GnuPG\n"
"           recipients (using its public keys). Select all the intended\n"
"           recipients in the list and press 'Ok'. Only recipients in the\n"
"           default keyring and with valid public keys are shown.  Be sure to\n"
"           always select your public, in addition to the keys of all other\n"
"           recipients that need to access the file. If you forget to add your\n"
"           public key, you won't be able to open the file yourself, as\n"
"           only the users with the private keys corresponding to the chosen\n"
"           public keys can decrypt the file.\n"
"\n"
"* Quit: close the program.  You will be prompted to save the file if it has\n"
"        changed since the last save.\n"
"\n"
"Edit menu\n"
"---------\n"
"\n"
"* Undo: undo most recent change in the text.\n"
"\n"
"* Redo: redo most recent undo in the text.\n"
"\n"
"* Cut: cut the selected text into the clipboard.\n"
"\n"
"* Copy: copy the selected text to the clipboard.\n"
"\n"
"* Paste: insert the clipboard text.\n"
"\n"
"* Find: find pieces of text in the editor.  Insert the text to find in the\n"
"        dialog and press 'ENTER'.  If the text is found it will be selected and\n"
"        shown in the editor window.  If not found, a warning will be given\n"
"        that the end of the file was reached -- you may restart the search\n"
"        from the top of the file.  Press 'ESCAPE' to close the dialog.\n"
"\n"
"* Replace: replace pieces of text in the editor.  Insert the text to find and\n"
"           the text to replace it in the dialog and press 'ENTER'.  If the\n"
"           text is found, you will be asked if you want to replace it.\n"
"\n"
"* Select all: select all text in the editor.\n"
"\n"
"* Settings: change the settings of the editor. Available options:\n"
"\n"
"    * Text color: change the color of the text. Click the button to open the\n"
"            color choosing dialog.\n"
"    * Background color: change the background (paper) color.  Click the button\n"
"            to open the color choosing dialog.\n"
"    * GnuPG path: choose the correct path to the GnuPG executable.  Click the\n"
"            button to open the file dialog.\n"
"    * GnuPG default recipients. Click the button to open the recipients dialog.\n"
"            The default recipients (may be just one) are the public keys that\n"
"            will be used to encrypt all the files at saving time, except if\n"
"            using the 'Save To' option. Be sure to always select your public\n"
"            key, or you won't be able to open the file -- only the users with\n"
"            the corresponding private keys to the chosen public keys can decrypt\n"
"            the file.\n"
"\n"
"Help menu\n"
