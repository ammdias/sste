"\n"
"SSTE is a simple-text editor that stores the files encrypted by GnuPG with its\n"
"default symmetric algorithm.  It depends on GnuPG and Python 3 with Tkinter.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Installation and first run\n"
"==========================\n"
"\n"
"To install, simply uncompress the zip file, navigate to the uncompressed\n"
"directory and run 'sste.py' with Python 3.\n"
"\n"
"Alternately, in Linux or other Unix-like operating system, you may use the\n"
"included installation script to install the program for a single user:\n"
"\n"
"    $ bash local_install.sh\n"
"\n"
"The program will try to find the GnuPG executable in the PATH.  If it can not\n"
"find it, it will prompt the user to manually provide the path in the Settings\n"
"Dialog (see below).  If GnuPG is not installed in your system, please download\n"
"it from the system's software store or, at your option, from the GnuPG site:\n"
"\n"
"* https://gnupg.org/download/index.html\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Usage\n"
"=====\n"
"\n"
"The program works as any common graphical simple-text editor.  You may insert,\n"
"delete, select, copy and paste text as usual.  When saving you will be prompted\n"
"to insert and confirm a password to encrypt the file.  Similarly, when opening\n"
"a file the program will ask for a password to decrypt the file.\n"
"\n"
"Below is a description of the menu items and its actions:\n"
"\n"
"File menu\n"
"---------\n"
"\n"
"* New: start editing a new file.  If the file you were currently editing was\n"
"       modified since the last save you will be prompted to save it.\n"
"\n"
"* Open: open a saved file.  When prompted insert the password used to encrypt\n"
"        the file and press 'ENTER'.  Press 'ESCAPE' to stay editing the same\n"
"        file.\n"
"\n"
"* Save: save the current file.  Insert the password to encrypt the file,\n"
"        confirm it and then press 'ENTER' to save the file.  Press 'ESCAPE'\n"
"        to cancel.\n"
"\n"
"* Save as: save the current file with a different name.\n"

"        shown in the editor window.  If not found, a warning will be given\n"
"        that the end of the file was reached -- you may restart the search\n"
"        from the top of the file.  Press 'ESCAPE' to close the dialog.\n"
"\n"
"* Replace: replace pieces of text in the editor.  Insert the text to find and\n"
