ABOUT THE PROGRAM
=================

This is a text editor (simple text) that stores the files encrypted
by GnuPG (default symmetric encryption).

Depends on Python 3.4+, with Tkinter, and GnuPG 2.


USAGE
=====

Before using, confirm that you have GnuPG and Python 3 with Tkinter installed
on your system.  If not, get them from your system's software store or from
the official download sites:

* Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
* GnuPG:  https://gnupg.org/download/index.html

The program needs no special installation: just unzip the the compressed
file and run 'sste.py' in the 'sste' directory, with Python 3.  Read the
program's help for further instructions on how to use it.
